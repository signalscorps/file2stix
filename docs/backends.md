# Backends

Backends allow you to store STIX Objects in a database of your choice in addition to the local filesystem. This section of the documentation shows available backends and how to configure them.

## Backend structure

Each Backend ships with a default initialization script that is used to create the database schema file2stix will write to. This is executed the first time the backend is used.

Backends authentication is specified using a backend `<CONFIG>.yml`.

This configuration file is passed when running file2stix commands. For example, 

```shell
file2stix --input-file tests/file_inputs/txt/input.txt --backend tests/backends/arangodb.yml
```

## Local filesystem

The default backend is filesystem storage.

When file2stix successfully executes and matches are detected two directories will be created;

1. `stix2_objects/`
	* `<object_type>`
		* `<object_id>`
			* `<object.json>` STIX Objects for observables detected. These are used for future runs of the script and to write Objects into other backends. In the sub-directories you will find STIX 2.1 Bundles containing individual STIX 2.1 Objects extracted.
2. `stix2_bundles/`
	* Final STIX bundles containing collections of Objects from observables extracted from reports. In the sub-directories you will find STIX 2.1 Bundles containing all STIX 2.1 Objects extracted from a report. Some examples can be seen in the `/tests/expected_reports` directory.

This backend is always used as the json files saved are used to populate other backends.

## ArangoDB (`arangodb`)

This backend is built to support the ArangoDB community version.

To do this user should supply a backend config file with the following structure;

```yml
backend: arangodb # specifies config is for arangodb backend. must be specified exactly as shown here
host: # optional, default if blank: 'http://127.0.0.1:8529'
username: # optional, default if blank: root
password: # optional, default if blank: ''
database_name: # optional, default if blank: 'file2stix'
document_collection_name: # optional, default if blank: 'stix_objects'
edge_collection_name: # optional, default if blank: 'stix_relationships'
```

The `username` supplied must have permissions in ArangoDB to create new Databases and Collections, and write to these Collections.

An example can be seen in `/tests/backends/arangodb.yml`.

By passing the `--backend` flag, the backend will be invoked. For example;

```shell
file2stix --input-file tests/file_inputs/txt/input.txt --backend tests/backends/arangodb.yml
```

The initialisation script `/backends/arangodb/arangodb.py` checks for the following in the ArangoDB instance;

* 1x Database (name defined in backend config file, default is `file2stix`)
* 1x Document Collection in the Database (name defined in backend config file, default is `stix_objects`)
* 1x Edge Collection in the Database (name defined in backend config file, default is `stix_relationships`)

If these exist, then they script will start writing data. If they do not exist, the script will create them and then start writing data.

file2stix stores newly created json files (representing STIX 2.1 Objects) created on each script run (in `stix2_objects/`) in each ArangoDB Collection.

file2stix only ever creates one version of an Object (with unique `id`), therefore only one version of an Object will ever exist in the Document and Edge ArangoDB Collections.

Here is how the STIX 2.1 Objects are stored in ArangoDB;

### STIX 2.1 Objects (except for Relationship SROs)

All STIX 2.1 Objects types (except for Relationship SROs) are stored in the Document Collection like so;

```json
{
	"_key": "<STIX OBJECT ID>",
	"<FULL STIX OBJECT PAYLOAD>"
}
```

Note, `<FULL STIX OBJECT PAYLOAD>` refers to the json key/values of the STIX Object. e.g.

```json
{
	"_key": "indicator--0eaa7158-bd7d-492f-b7c3-cb47f4ed85ab",
	"type": "indicator",
	"spec_version": "2.1",
	"id": "indicator--0eaa7158-bd7d-492f-b7c3-cb47f4ed85ab",
	"created": "2022-09-07T06:11:36.285448Z",
	"modified": "2022-09-07T09:27:21.741076Z",
	"name": "ipv4: 198.0.103.12:8000",
	"indicator_types": [
		"unknown"
	],
	"pattern": "[ ipv4-addr:value = '198.0.103.12' AND network-traffic:dst_port = '8000' ]",
	"pattern_type": "stix",
	"pattern_version": "2.1",
	"valid_from": "2022-09-07T06:11:36.285448Z",
	"object_marking_refs": [
		"marking-definition--613f2e26-407d-48c7-9eca-b8e91df99dc9"
	]
}
```

### Relationship STIX 2.1 Objects

All STIX 2.1 Objects with type `relationship` are stored in the Edge Collection like so;

```json
{
	"_key": "<STIX RELATIONSHIP OBJECT ID>",
	"_from": "stix_objects/<STIX RELATIONSHIP OBJECT SOURCE_REF>",
	"_to": "stix_objects/<STIX RELATIONSHIP OBJECT TARGET_REF>",
	"<FULL STIX RELATIONSHIP OBJECT PAYLOAD>"
}
```

Note, `<FULL STIX RELATIONSHIP OBJECT PAYLOAD>` refers to the json key/values of the STIX Object. e.g.

```json
{
	"_key": "relationship--4bc6e063-2547-4f5d-8f30-fd6cca4037f7",
	"_from": "stix_objects/indicator--945df870-12cd-4e28-a90a-46fb6918278c",
	"_to": "stix_objects/report--b5d4d317-510f-4413-8d88-388e46cfa18b",
	"type": "relationship",
	"spec_version": "2.1",
	"id": "relationship--4bc6e063-2547-4f5d-8f30-fd6cca4037f7",
	"created": "2022-09-07T09:28:24.077169Z",
	"modified": "2022-09-07T09:28:24.077169Z",
	"relationship_type": "default-extract-from",
	"source_ref": "indicator--945df870-12cd-4e28-a90a-46fb6918278c",
	"target_ref": "report--b5d4d317-510f-4413-8d88-388e46cfa18b",
	"object_marking_refs": [
		"marking-definition--613f2e26-407d-48c7-9eca-b8e91df99dc9"
	]
}
```

### Embedded relationship (`*_ref` and `*_refs`) properties

All `*_ref` and `*_refs` properties are converted to custom relationship objects (not STIX Objects) and stored in the Edge Collection as follows;

```json
{
	"_key": "<OBJECT WITH REF PROPERTY>+<OBJECT BEING REFERENCED>",
	"_from": "stix_objects/<OBJECT WITH REF PROPERTY>",
	"_to": "stix_objects/<OBJECT BEING REFERENCED>",
	"type": "embedded-relationship",
	"relationship_description": "<PROPERTY NAME>",
	"deprecated": false
}
```

For example;

```json
{
	"_key": "report--b5d4d317-510f-4413-8d88-388e46cfa18b+indicator--945df870-12cd-4e28-a90a-46fb6918278c",
	"_from": "stix_objects/report--84e4d88f-44ea-4bcd-bbf3-b2c1c320bcb3",
	"_to": "stix_objects/indicator--26ffb872-1dd9-446e-b6f5-d58527e5b5d2",
	"type": "embedded-relationship",
	"relationship_description": "object_refs",
	"deprecated": false
}
```
Note, the `deprecated` property in file2stix will always equal `false` because no embedded relationship properties are ever removed in an UPDATE.

### Dealing with updates to extracted Objects (SDOs)

In the case of Reports marked TLP WHITE, updates can happen to extracted objects when they are seen for a second time. The only update that will happen to these Objects will be that their `modified` time property will increase. This makes dealing with updates fairly trivial.

First, a new Object is created, identical to the original (created on previous run), however, with a different `_key` in the format `id`+`modified` properties, for example;

```sql
INSERT {
  "_key": "report--84e4d88f-44ea-4bcd-bbf3-b2c1c320bcb3+2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
  "type": "report",
  "id": "report--84e4d88f-44ea-4bcd-bbf3-b2c1c320bcb3",
  "created": "2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
  "modified": "2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
  "name": "The Black Vine Cyberespionage Group",
  "description": "A simple report with an indicator and campaign",
  "published": "2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
  "report_types": ["campaign"],
  "object_refs": [
    "indicator--26ffb872-1dd9-446e-b6f5-d58527e5b5d2",
    "campaign--83422c77-904c-4dc1-aff5-5c38f3a2c55c",
    "relationship--f82356ae-fe6c-437c-9c24-6b64314ae68a"
  ]
} IN stix_objects
```

Then, the original ArangoDB object for this entry (in this case `_key: report--84e4d88f-44ea-4bcd-bbf3-b2c1c320bcb3`) is UPDATEd to reflect the changes;

```sql
UPDATE {
  "_key": "report--84e4d88f-44ea-4bcd-bbf3-b2c1c320bcb3",
  "type": "report",
  "id": "report--84e4d88f-44ea-4bcd-bbf3-b2c1c320bcb3",
  "created": "2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
  "modified": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "name": "A new name",
  "description": "A new report",
  "published": "2015-12-21T19:59:11.000Z",
  "report_types": ["campaign"],
  "object_refs": [
    "indicator--26ffb872-1dd9-446e-b6f5-d58527e5b5d2",
    "campaign--83422c77-904c-4dc1-aff5-5c38f3a2c55c",
    "relationship--f82356ae-fe6c-437c-9c24-6b64314ae68a"
  ]
} IN stix_objects
```

As no other updates happen in file2stix (e.g. changes to old relationships) no other action is needed when such an update happens.

### Dealing with updates to extracted Objects (SCOs)

Due to the way SCOs are handled (optional properties are not considered) then SCOs always retain the same `id` assuming the `value` field is the same.

https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_q6l05xzpcdf

This means SCOs are overwritten, and not versioned in arangodb the same way.

There will be multiple revisions of the object (with different values for `_rev` for each overwrite). The revision (`_rev`) attribute is just there as a marker so you can know when a field was updated. You can't change it directly, but every time you UPDATE a document in a collection, the `_rev` value is updated. You will need to use this to see version history of SCOs.
